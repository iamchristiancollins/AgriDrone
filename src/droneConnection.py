# #

# # the WIFI SSID (e.g. TELLO-58A55) will appear, as though it were any other WIFI network.

# # Once running, this 
# # To put the drone into SDK mode, send it: "command".
# #
# # This allows the drone to accept other commands.
# #
# # You can find the full list of commands the drones can accept
# # on the Tello SDK user guide
# # 
# # To sever your connection, send "end".
