# Drone Table UI

## Project Description
Drone Table UI is an interactive desktop application developed with Python and Tkinter. It allows users to control a drone's movement in two different modes: Scan and Hover. The application interfaces with a simulated drone or an actual DJI Tello drone, captures images, and displays them within the user interface. This project is ideal for drone enthusiasts and developers interested in drone technology and application development.

## Features
- **Two Operational Modes:** Users can switch between Scan and Hover modes, each with distinct control mechanisms and display features.
- **Real-Time Image Display:** Captures and displays images from the drone's camera in real time.
- **Dynamic UI:** Provides interactive elements such as buttons, text inputs, and visual feedback directly related to the drone's operation.
